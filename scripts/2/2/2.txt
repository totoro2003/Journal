After that request@.@.@. I
told him to sit down.@@

I needed to tell him.@ I needed
to tell him everything about what 
will happen. I feel like he's ready
to finally know.@

I sat him down.

"Listen Matt, I'm going to be gone
for a very long ti-" 
"I know, I know all about that" He
interrupted me.
"I already knew all of that, but why? 
Why are you leaving."@

I was surprised, scared, happy, sad,
angry, and consumed all the same.@

"Because I have to Matt,@ I have to."

I didn't want to leave him without 
any answers at the very least.@@

He was pretty quiet after that.@ I
left the room to leave him with
his thoughts.@
