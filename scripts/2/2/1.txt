and when he said that, I 
was a bit confused, but of 
course I stayed around.@

I know what he's been going 
through throughout the time i've
been gone.@ 

"How come@.@.@. they don't want you?"@
I was hoping that he didn't ask this,
atleast not yet, but I can understand
what he was being fed back at the house.@

"Because well.@.@.@ I'm not sure why"@ 
I didn't think he was ready to know the
truth, it could shatter him inside.@

"Well, because of that, I was alone
for ever.@ I wish you were there with
me, but for whatever reason they don't 
want you anywhere near me anymore. I'm
really happy they let me stay now.@.@.
but,"@

He stayed silent after that. I think
he was carefully selecting his words,
like he was preparing to say something
serious.@

"I'm smarter than you think."@@

I wonder what he meant by that...He
softly smiled at me after that, and went back
in his room, or, not yet.@

"I'm prepared to be alone again after today."@
