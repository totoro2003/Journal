I was in bed for a while, thinking
about how he will be without me,
if he's ready to be on his own.@

I went in his room to check on him,
but he was already up eating a bowl
of cereal. When I asked, he said
that he didn't need anything
else.@ I was planning on making
him a big breakfast, though I 
guess this is alright.@

I went over to sit down with him.@

"I knew everything before."@
"I know"@@

"Thanks for everything."@
"Thank you for everything, too."@@

I needed that.@

"I had to think about things for
a while, but I think I'm ok
about everything, and that I can
handle it.@ I've been alone for
a while now, but these past
days were really fun together!
I had a lot of fun getting
to see your pets again, getting
to eat your food for one last
time, and getting to spend a 
few days together, like a long 
time ago.@ I think it's sad, but
I think I'll be okay with everything."@@

I think I learned something then. I'm
not sure what he tried to teach me exactly,
but I know that it was really important to
learn. Especially from him. What he's given
to me was something more than anything that
I've gotten from anyone ever before,@ a
little brother.@

I'll never forget about all those times
that he told me to study with him, all
those times when I would tell him to
stop pushing himself so hard in school.@
He always tried to do the best in school,
but he didn't need to, I think.@

Eventually the time came. Matt had to
go,@ but we were both ready to say
our goodbyes.@

And so we did, and didn't look back
misty eyed.@

But before he left, I gave him this.
