I'm sorry Matt,@ I can't do
anything about this. I can't
do a fraction of what I want
for you.@@

I can't do anything.@@@





Matt woke up to me next to his
door. He woke my up with tears
in my eyes from late last night.@
I couldn't think of anything 
other than how powerless I was.@

I began to lament to him about 
everything. I tried so hard to 
forget about everything over the
last few years. Everything that me
and Matt had to go through, and
everything that made Matt feel
so alone.@@

Just when I felt so alone,@ so
scared,@ and so powerless,@ I 
remembered who was there besides
me, and who let me cry. Matt sat 
there besides me the whole time
until I got better.@

@Thanks for that.@

Later, we got started on breakfast,
of course, Matt helped with it. I
showed him how I made eggs and he
attempted at them as well. Behind
my back, he tried to flip over
pancakes like they do in movies.@
I cleaned the pancake from the floor 
after he finished.@

We sat and enjoyed our meal. It 
wasn't too big, but I made sure
to make it good.@ I was surprised
on how well he made the eggs.@

Eventually, the time came for him to
go.@ This was the last time I would
have ever spoken with him, but I think
I'll be okay with it.@ I really,@ really,@
really didn't want to let him go, but I 
already shed so many tears the previous night.@

Before he went away, he told me something, something
that would be the most precious thing I've ever
heard.@
He's grown up already.@

Before he left, I gave him something.
