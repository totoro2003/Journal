My brother and i laughed as we 
usually would together. He'd play
in the farm, and i'd make us
dinner. He really loves those
animals.@

Since this time is special
between us, I told him we
could eat whatever he wanted.@

Then, he told me he
1:@ Wanted breakfast for dinner. /
2:@ already ate and wasn't hungry.
