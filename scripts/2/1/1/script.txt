I had fun eating dinner with
him last night, but the thought
of him leaving had polluted my
mind.@

I did like having another day 
like the old ones we used to
have,@ nothing but pure fun 
together.@ It did make me sad 
though.@@

Matt woke up to a big breakfast,
of course. I made it really special
for him, the same one we would
eat together early before school,
except not nearly as much.@

Of course it was a fun time with
him, my little brother could always
make everyone smile,@ anyone he
wanted to.@

Right before he left, I had
to make sure to talk with him.@ I
didn't want to just watch him walk
out of the door like always. He's 
my little brother, and this will
be our final time together.@ I want
our last moments to be something
he holds on to for a long,@ long
time.@

"Matt, I just want you to know@ that
you're everything to me, right now."
I held him close to me. I didn't want
to be alone again after he went out that 
door, even though it's inevitable.@@


"I'm so glad that we got to jump
in the leaf pile again."@ Matt said,
right as it was time to go. He had
trouble keeping it all in, so I held
him closer.@
"You don't have to hide it anymore,@ let
everything out."@ I whispered in his ear.
He complyed very quickly. I felt intermmitent
streams on my shoulders as I could tell he
had trouble keeping it all in now.@@


Even though I didn't want to, the constant
horns outside forced me to let go.@ It was time
for him to go. As he left, those words he left
as well proved to me that he didn't need me 
anymore.@

When the door shut, I almost couldn't stand.@
I sat there alone in front of a door that 
blocked the suns beautiful rays.@ Nothing
but desire filled my empty heart. A desire
to walk out of the door, a desire to take him
back,@ and a desire to die.@@


After a while, I eventually collected myself 
and stood back up.@ I knew what I had to do now.
Its what I would've wanted myself to do if I were
Matt,@

so I left him something.@@
