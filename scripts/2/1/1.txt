Usually, I wouldn't have
let him go play outside after just
eating, but this is a special
occasion. I thought about it for
a little while, but eventually I
let him go out and play.@

He grabbed my hand, which was
surprising to me. Of course, I
went with him. I didn't know what
He wanted me to do with him, but
we went over to the den with many
of the animals. The ones that
weren't still sleeping were eating
the food I gave them earlier.@

My brother went to go get some 
food and fed Mary a bunch of it.
I watched him as he fed her more 
of the food.@@



After sitting there for a little
while, he grabbed my hand, and
hurried over to the leaf piles I
raked earlier.@@

We jumped in them again.@@
