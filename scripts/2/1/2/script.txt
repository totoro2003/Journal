The last day, I guess.@@


Matt woke up to a plate of pancakes
and eggs. We ate together, liked we
used to,@ like nothing happened, or
would happen.@

We sat together, washing dishes,
like nothing happened.@

We watched tv, played, and did 
everything together, like
nothing happened.@

I didn't feel as heart broken and
empty as before,@ and a great part of
that was because he didn't either.@ I 
was so glad to see that he wasn't as sad 
as I originally thought, but it did feel
bittersweet, as anything would.@ I never 
would've thought that my brother wouldv'e
accepted never seeing me again so easy,@

but, he didn't accept it as easily as
I thought. I know what will come in 
the future, just when he see's how much
of an effect we had on eachother for our
lives.@

But he already has seen everything. He
knows, he knows what will happen in the
future. If I'm wrong, i'll make sure that
he knows of one thing, @@

I love you, Matt.@@

I know that he's heard those words many, many 
times before,@ but this time it's the last
one that he will recieve from me.@

Before he left out of the door, he did
look back towards me,@ and I know exactly
what he meant by it.@

I was left alone when he closed the door.@
I slowly slid down the door as I had trouble
keeping in the flowing streams that were my
tears.@ I spent my entire life with my 
little brother,@ and now,@@ he's gone.@@

So I left him something for when I am too,@
simular to what he left me,@

Goodbye, little brother, and I love you@
