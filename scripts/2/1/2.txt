I sat down with him. He
sat there looking stuffed.
I really did make a lot of 
food for him.@

He did look at me again 
after a while, though. I 
think he wanted to talk with 
me.@ 

"Where are you going?"@ His 
question caught me by surprise,
because I didn't know how he.@.@
knew?@

"Somewhere where you cant go"@
I decided to be honest with him.
I feel like he can handle it.
I didn't know if that was the
right choice, but, If anything, 
I don't want to leave him with
with any answers.@

He didn't stay quiet for long
after I answered him.@

".@.@. I'll be ok"@
"What do you mean?"
"I don't think,@ I'll
need you anymore"@

Hearing that kind of hurt
inside at first, but now I know
what he meant by that.@ 

I'll know i'll miss him.@@
Always.@
