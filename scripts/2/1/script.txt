he was. I haven't made
us breakfast that well
for a long time. He asked 
if it were a special
occasion,@ "no, I just 
felt like stuffing you up
with good food before
you go"@

to get full, because he didn't 
look like he was having as 
much fun eating,@ "If you
can't finish it, you don't 
have to-" He interrupted me 
with a loud grunt.@

After an hour, he finally
finished. I may have overrestimated
how much he could eat, but when
he finished, he-
