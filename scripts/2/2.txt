After telling me he wasn't hungry,
he went back outside.@

He always spent his time outside.
I suppose he *is* a young boy, and
i do enjoy watching him having fun.@

Playing in the bushes, racing the dogs,
it's nice to see how active he is at
such a young age. I really wish we 
had more time together.@
