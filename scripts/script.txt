Ever since the fall began, the
leaves started to grow slightly red,
and i would find piles of them
decorating the yard.
@
This morning, before my brother came,
i raked up a leaf pile since I know how
much he likes jumping in those.
@
The first thing he did when he came
was
1@ kissed mom goodbye/
2@ ran up to my door

(type 1 or 2):
