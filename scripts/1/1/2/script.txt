Matt woke up to a big breakfast. 
I think he felt better after what
happened yesterday,@ I sat over
and ate with him. We stayed in
silence until he finished.@

I continued to sit there even
after he finished eating. I didn't
feel much better than before, so I
didn't have the energy to move. Matt
seemed more like his usual self today,
jumping around, playing outside, and
talking to me, sometimes.@

I was glad to see him better than
before. I think I felt my heart shrink
a little when I noticed his attitude
ealier. Imagining how he felt,@ knowing 
everything,@ it just.@.@.@

I decided to sit with him and watch
TV until it was time.@ I liked watching 
his favorite cartoons with him, and 
seeing him laugh. Matt's smile is pretty
contagious.@

Eventually, the time came,@ he had to leave
again.@

He went out the door, looking at the me the 
whole way out,@ though he did leave with a 
smile.@

Goodbye@

He was silent when he went out the door, yet
he didn't need to speak for me to hear his 
voice.@ 

I was there, alone,@ like I was when it all
began all that time ago.@'

I should get started on something.@ I had
an idea last night. When I held him in my arms,
I knew I couldn't just leave him like last 
night. He'll come back for me, maybe.@ When 
he does, i'll give him a peice of myself 
as well.@

I love you too,@ Little brother@@
