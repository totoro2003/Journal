"you're...all i have"@

Those words kept me up at night.
Even pounding my head couldn't
shake that sentence out.@ 

Just thinking about it..@ How can
I even put it on paper?@

Well, whats more fitting to pollute
my thoughts on the last day with
him?@ It was hard out of bed in the
morning,@ to say the least.@

When I woke up, I immediately got 
work started in the kitchen. Any small
amount of food would help him feel even
slightly better, though I knew the right
meal that would be best,@ the one I used
to make him for breakfast everyday.@

Pancakes were always his favorite. I 
remember when he was still little and he
would beg for them.@ Mom could never make
them better than I could,@ fitting for the
chef of the family.@

He woke up to a big breakfast, and I'm 
pretty sure he wasn't surprised.@ I sat
with him with a plate I made for myself.@
I could hear the syrup drop from the
small peice I found myself staring at.
It was the longest ten minutes I've 
ever had before.@ "So, are you really
going away?"@

He must've heard my phone call with mom. 
That's the only explanation I can come up 
with, because she was the only other 
person I've told. I'd love for her and I
to get along better, but that phone call
was a reminder that that's only a star too
high to reach for.@ 

Oh well.@

I guess the time had to come eventually.@ I
do think, though, that he is ready. I can't
be there for him anymore.@ My only hope is 
that everything doesn't have to go back
to how it was before. Nothing has to be 
like it was,@ before@

Before he left out the door, he hugged me closely,
closer than last night.@ "Don't forget about me when
you come back"@ I whispered softly in his ear.@

He left, looking back the way out. My heart almost
broke when I heard his voice for the last time.@

Once the door closed, I realised what had just
left from me.@ My little brother was gone, the same
one I spent a lifetime watching, raising, and caring
for, and now I'm all alone.@ 

After realising what he must've been through,
ever since he heard that call I had trouble 
standing. But@.@.@. I think I knew what to do.@
Even since last night, I knew what I had to do.@

After those bittersweet hugs, I knew how alone
he feels now. But, I know that I can help him
through it, even if I'm not there for him, I can
atleast give him my words, so@

I love you, little brother.@@
