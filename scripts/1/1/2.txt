"i dare you to come here, and give
me a hug."@

He slowly came forward to me, and  
pressed his head on my torso.@ I
carefully placed my arms over his
back and pressed him to me.@

I felt him tear up more in my arms,
but I just sat there with him.@

"I'm sorry.@ I wish i didn't have 
to leave you alone anymore."@

I almost choked on my words.@
