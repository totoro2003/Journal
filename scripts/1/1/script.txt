"Truth or Dare" I asked. Of course, being
the boy he is, he chose a dare. "Well, I 
dare you to.@.@.@" I had to think about this. 
this was a good opportunity to ask him
whats going on.@

"..tell me why you seem so sad?" He
doesn't seem like himself today. I want to
know why, so I can actually help him. Of
course, he told me that he was alright,
which was the biggest lie i've ever heard.@

"My turn. Truth, or Dare?" He said, 
brushing off my original question. Maybe..@
he's just@ quieter than usual?@ I'm not sure,
but i do think that something is definately 
off about him today.@

"Truth", I said. Maybe i shouldv'e did a
dare instead,@ or, thats what i thought
before.@

"What.@.@.@do you@ want@?@"@

His question.@.@ was confusing. I wasn't sure
what he meant. "Well, i just.."@
I couldn't think of the words.@ 
I wasn't sure what he meant, but..@
i thought, "maybe i should just 
be honest with him.@"

"I want you to tell me whats wrong!"@

I was a bit more harsh this time. I thought
i may have pushed him too hard but.. I wasn't 
sure of anything. Maybe he *was* fine,@ but 
that still makes me wonder about the sudden 
change of attitude.@

"Your turn."@

Im not sure what to do about this, but.@.@
if anything, i don't want him to feel
alone@.@. i guess.@.@

"truth or dare?" I asked, and he 
resonded-

1:@ "truth"
2:@ "dare"
