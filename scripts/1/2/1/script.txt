Matt had just woken up.
I wondered how he was feeling
after last night.@

When I went to check on
him in his room, I glanced
around his room to see if he 
left the picture I gave him, 
but I couldn't find anything.@

He woke up to a really
big breakfast that I made
him before he left. He 
looked really happy, and
I couldv'e sworn he ate it
all in one bite! He must've 
been really hungry then!@

When he finished his breakfast, 
I started to realise something.@
All of those years I spent with
Matt, Everything I've done
with him.@.@.@ was all over.@

This was the last time.@ The
last time I would see him 
again.@

But I knew that already. I
knew for a long time before
now. I knew when I told Mom
that I wanted to see him 
again. This was my last
time with him.@

"Hey Matt? Can I talk to 
you?" I asked him. He came
over, and I think he already
knew what I had to say
to him.@

"Matt,@ I think we both
know.@.@ that this is our last
time together.@ I want you
to know that I love you with
every part of myself, and that 
I wish I could be there-" I 
started to choke up a little.
I guess all of my emotions got
to me.@
"I wish I could be there.@.@ to
see you grow up into a man, and
take care of your family.@ I 
know you feel lonely, and I wish
I could fill that hole in your
heart for longer, but I have no
choice.@ I just want you to 
know@ that@ I@ love you."@@


After I told that to him, I hugged 
him.@ Tighter than I ever did.@ He
hugged me back, and said something
to me. I couldn't hear it, but I knew
exactly what it was.@@

Staying near the couch for a while,
I forgot the time. Matt had to go.@

Before he walked out the door again,
"Thank you, sis!@ and goodbye"@ He
said to me.@

The door closed before I could
say thank you back. I was left
there, alone. There was nothing
else for me to do except wait@@

or so i thought@.@.@

I decided to leave Matt a gift,
instead. I thought of a few things
I could leave, maybe another 
picture?@ Cash?@

I eventually settled on an idea
instead,@ my ideas, thoughts,
and emotions. Maybe a way that
he didn't have to feel alone
anymore.@

So I left him this.@@
