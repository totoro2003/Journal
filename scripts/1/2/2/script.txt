Matt woke up to a big
breakfast. I wanted to 
make it really special for
him since that was his
last day here.@ With me@

While he was eating, I noticed
the picture sitting over on
the kitchen counter. It was
so long ago.@

I didn't have to worry about 
anything. I didn't even know
I'd have to lose Matt one
day. Those years were so
special to me, and I do wish
that I appriciated them more
when I was experiencing them.@

Now,@ those days are over. I'll
be alone again once Matt leaves.
Coming home from school, I'd 
have never think about the fact
that I wouldn't have anyone to 
come home to again.@

I spent a lot of our time
left taking with Matt and playing
with the animals with him, like
when we were younger.@

Eventually, the time came. Matt
had to go.@ After seeing that picture
again, I didn't want to have a day 
filled with pain.@ One last day,@ One
last day with Matt,@ and I wanted it
to be a happy one.@ I should be 
happy today, for him. And, until
that point, I was.@

"Matt..@ before you go"
I choked on my words. ".@.@thanks,@
for the picture@"

"I love you, sis"@

I wonder now. If he knew that I was
going to leave.@@ 

After he left, I was
left alone, in front of the door.@

The door closed before I could
say thank you back. I was left
there, alone. There was nothing
else for me to do except wait@@

Sitting in front of a door wont
make me less sad, but.@.@ I do
know what I can do instead.@

I'll give Matt a peice of myself.@
Something,@ that will make him 
feel less lonely.@

@Anything,@ to make him less lonely.@

So@.@.@.I decided to leave Matt a gift,
instead. I thought of a few things
I could leave, maybe another 
picture?@ Cash?@

I eventually settled on an idea
instead,@ my ideas, thoughts,
and emotions. Maybe a way that
he didn't have to feel alone
anymore.@

So I left him this.@@
