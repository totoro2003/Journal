"Oh, it's you!"
I bet he already had 
forgotten about our 
game. I was surprised
that he was so 
interested in the old
things i kept.@

We looked at many of
our old photos. You 
could almost see the
brightness in his eyes.@

I got choked up looking
at some of these pictures.
They're of us when matt
was so young.@ I remember
when I would hold and 
rock him to sleep when
he was still a baby.@

"Who're they?"@
"That's us, Matt!"@
It was a picture of me and
matt. I was still in highschool
back then, and he was just 
born.@ He cried so much
back then.@ Those days are
so precious to me.@.@.@

"Here, Matt" I wanted to 
give him the picture, and 
he:

1:@ kept it /
2:@ said I should keep it
