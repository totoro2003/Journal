I knew he would ask to play
this with me eventually. No matter
what i always find him. Sometimes,
I even think that he wants me to.@

When we were about to start, he told 
me that he wanted to be the seeker first.
This wasn't usual, but i couldn't see why
not.@

I looked around for a good place to 
hide. I felt like making it a challenge
for him to find me for the first time.@

Almost immediatly, I thought about the
attic. I haven't been in there for a while,
and either has my brother. I think that
has great potential to be a good hiding
place, however, I don't want it to be
too hard for him. He is a young child after 
all.@

I decided to leave a hint for him to come 
find me. The attic uses a ladder that comes
down to the floor once the trapdoor is open, 
letting anyone able to climb up. I left the
ladder down there. It provides a hint, and i'm
pretty sure he's too small to get the ladder 
down by himself. I'm so excited!.@



@In the attic, there were many pictures i could
find, bathing in dust, of course. I had
completly forgotten about most of my belongings,
the pictures that i mentioned earlier, were 
the only ones that weren't hidden away in
boxes.@

Taking a closer look at the pictures, I noticed
of whom they were.@
Us.@.@

All of our laughter, our happiness, and our family
within these images.@ I haven't seen us like
this in so long. 

Mom, Dad.@.@.@, I haven't talked with them@ in
such a long time before yesterday when my
brother came.@.@ 

I'm greatful for them. They weren't perfect,@ but
they let me hang out with matt for one last time.@
Ill miss them all.@@

My brother found me while I was dumbfounded by those
pictures
